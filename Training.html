        <h3>Training</h3>
        
        <p class="intro-description">NOTE: Any “workout” should start with easy jogging for 10-15 minutes followed by mobility drills, fast drills, dynamic stretching etc. Maybe some light strides too. Pretty much just do what you would normally do. Easy/Non-workout days should begin similarly but with lighter stretching and drills.</p>
        
        <div class="">
            <details class="demo-set">
                <summary class="demo-set-title">Recovery: lightest runs</summary>
                <p class="demo-set-description">Recovery runs are your lightest runs. Consider these runs as “jogs” <b>that should feel almost too slow</b>. Consciously think about keeping the pace slow. This is not a competition. Challenge yourself to run without a watch, tracking the run, or use a non-GPS watch.</p></details>
            
            <details class="demo-set">
                <summary class="demo-set-title">Split: split one run into two</summary>
                <p class="demo-set-description">Higher mileage days may have two recovery runs in a day (split recovery). If you see “split” on your training plan, it is recommended that you break up your mileage for that day. If we split for an off-day, split it as close to in half as possible (i.e. recovery day of 8 miles might be split 4/4 or 3/5).</p></details>
            
            <details class="demo-set">
                <summary class="demo-set-title">Distance: usual runs, most of your summer mileage runs</summary>
                <p class="demo-set-description">Distance runs are the bread and butter of the summer. They should be light or light-medium days. They will generally be faster than recovery days. <b>They should go by feel and not be forced</b>. Feel free to run progressively faster if you feel good but <b>sparingly, not everyday</b>.</p></details>
            
            <details class="demo-set">
                <summary class="demo-set-title">Long Runs: long runs duh, 60+ min</summary>
                <p class="demo-set-description">Long runs are the <b>most important</b> training days of the summer. They should be considered medium efforts because of the volume <b>not because of the intensity</b>. They should also be at a similar pace when compared to distance runs. Because of their lengths, please hydrate and fuel well before and after long runs. If possible, do the same throughout the run in intervals.</p></details>
            
            <details class="demo-set">
                <summary class="demo-set-title">Tempo: a little slower than race pace (5K)</summary>
                <p class="demo-set-description">Tempo runs are considered medium to medium-hard efforts. They should be about 30 to 60 sec/mile slower than your 5K pace. Another way to think about the effort of a tempo run is that it feels “comfortably hard.” You should be able to speak in short breaths without gasping for air during the run. A trick is to say the phrase “I feel good, I feel great, I want to communicate” out loud. It’s important that these reps are run at the correct EFFORT!</p></details>
            
            <details class="demo-set">
                <summary class="demo-set-title">Progression: progressive faster pace throughout a run</summary>
                <p class="demo-set-description">Progression runs should ALWAYS go from the slower end of the pace range to the faster end by feel. Let your body determine how much and how fast you progress. Aim to go faster than tempo pace toward the end of the run if possible.</p></details>
        
            <details class="demo-set">
                <summary class="demo-set-title">Fartlek: speed play </summary>
                <p class="demo-set-description">Most people know that fartlek is a Swedish word for “speed play.” They are considered medium to medium-hard efforts. It is important to note two things with fartleks: variability and recovery. First, the variability during the fast portions can change dramatically. You should choose a relatively fast pace that you can maintain for the desirable duration. If you want to change the pace, feel free to take on the speed play element of fartleks but make sure you can maintain that speed. Second, these are NOT intervals. The slower portions are not jogs, they’re active recovery. By keeping the pace not drastically different from the faster sections, it teaches your body to efficiently recover and enhances speed endurance (for intervals up to 2-3 minutes). A guide is to separate the fast and slow portions by 60 to 90 sec/mile. Note, these runs are continuous.</p></details>
            
            <details class="demo-set">
                <summary class="demo-set-title">Interval/Repeats:</summary>
                <p class="demo-set-description">Very similar to fartlek but the fast portions are dependent on distance instead of time. They are considered hard efforts. These tend to be more rigid with significantly less flexibility with speed play and variation. Likewise, rest portions are Some common examples are mile repeats, VO2max, 5x1000, and 8x400. Note: these runs are NOT continuous, but you are encouraged to engage in active recovery, dynamic stretching, dynamic drills etc. between reps.</p></details>
            
            <details class="demo-set">
                <summary class="demo-set-title">Shakeout: speed play during run</summary>
                <p class="demo-set-description">Very similar to fartlek. They are considered light efforts. These runs take the base of recovery/distance runs with short spurts (25-35 sec) of fast portions once every few (4-6) minutes. You should be able to converse easily during the off portions.</p></details>
            
            <details class="demo-set">
                <summary class="demo-set-title">Tag Run</summary>
                <p class="demo-set-description">They are very similar to shakeouts but take the base of distance runs. They are considered medium to medium-hard effort depending on structure and base pace. Find a group of at least 5 people but no more than 8 people. Run in single file at the base pace. The person at the end will speed up and run to the front while everyone else maintains the base pace. This occurs once every 10 sec, then 5, then rapid-fire. People may be dropped, but keep going.</p></details>
            
            <details class="demo-set">
                <summary class="demo-set-title">Hill Sprints: sprinting up a positive slope</summary>
                <p class="demo-set-description">Self explanatory. You should be taking FULL AND COMPLETE REST between these repetitions. This could be up to 2-3 minutes if necessary. DO NOT RUSH! You should do your hill sprints after a good warmup and plenty of drills. Supplement the day with a nice mileage run after the hill sprints.</p></details>
            
            <details class="demo-set">
                <summary class="demo-set-title">Cross Training (XT): not primarily running but still staying active</summary>
                <p class="demo-set-description">Cross training is engagement in any activity or exercise that targets in areas separate from the main sport: running, track, field. They do not need to be primarily aerobic in nature. Some examples are biking, swimming, aqua jogging, rowing, ellipticalling, hiking, etc. Aim to do include these to add variability to your training. A general rule of thumb is to bike 2.5-3 times the duration/distance as running.</p></details>
            
            <details class="demo-set">
                <summary class="demo-set-title">Strides: fast and smooth, but not sprinting</summary>
                <p class="demo-set-description">Strides are typically run at the end of many medium to hard days, whether they’d be distance workout days. They are generally 4-10x100-150m. Strides should be relaxed, but fast and smooth. This is an opportunity to practice running with good form – tall posture, good arm carriage, proper knee drive (technically hip extension but it’s too long of a conversation), cycling form, etc. Feel free to do them on a flat surface or one with a slight incline. If you do, incorporate both uphill and downhill strides. If possible, you are encouraged to do strides barefoot on soft surfaces. Do not do them barefoot on gravel, rocky, or other potentially dangerous terrains. Again, this is NOT a competition or race. Focus on your form.</p></details>
